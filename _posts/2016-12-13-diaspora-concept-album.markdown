                     The heater is beeping again, either it's out of kerosene or another 3 hours have passed by. My eyes engrossed on the display, fixated on creating an idea which had been stuck in my head. Straight through the day the concepts and sounds aching to escape my mind into reality as soon as I'd get home from work. "...work...", I murmur to myself as I glide the cursor up to the top of the screen, completely clueless to what time will drop down from the status bar. 11pm? 2am? I've no clue and that fact is that it doesn't really matter because I know I'm not going to bed until I finish what I set out to do. Excellent, it's only half past 1 still a few hours left in me. I hope my wife doesn't get too worried if I don't sleep tonight, yet again.

                    <a href="http://mannymarx.com/Diaspora">"Diaspora</a> was more than just an album to me. I guess I could call it a <i>"passion project"</i> but that sounds ridged and divisive, Diaspora was more animate than that. It pushed me to my creative and technical limits. Not only was I composing music and writing lyrics but I was also designing and coding a dynamic web-page from scratch. There is probably some Ancient Greek or German word which sums it up better but in layman's terms <i>I was firing at all cylinders</i>. There were many days where I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRG7fZuQSk0">"ignited the midnight petroleum"</a>.

                <p>
                    <h3>So what exactly is Diaspora?</h3></p>

                     <p>Diaspora is a science fiction concept album / short story about(?) humanity's relation with itself, its relationship with technology, and its relationship with itself with technology. In brief, the setting takes place in the not too distant future right after a super virus brings the world's population, in less than a decade, to a few billion people. This shock to the system birthed a paradigm shift in how humans related to each other and objective reality. Also, in the mad-dash for a cure to combat the virus many technological breakthroughs took place. Notably, the ability to digitize consciousness, in large part inspired by Richard K. Morgan's cyberpunk masterpiece, and soon to be Netflix series, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altered_Carbon">"Altered Carbon"</a>.</p> 
                     <p> The Diaspora album begins when an exploration team on Jupiter's moon Europa comes across an artifact which is in the form of a tesseract. The music on the album itself are audio files which are streams of consciousness from the distant future. These range from space janitor at work to a patron at a bar who is smitten by a particular barkeep.</p><br>

                    <p>Personally, Diaspora has a binary meaning. On one hand, it's an anthropological statement. On the other hand, it was a polymorphic endeavor, in other words, a challenge to my inner Renaissance man. Not to regurgitate too much of my neurosis on you but creating Diaspora was a push back against this current era's <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/we-live-in-a-one-track-world-but-anyone-can-become-a-polymath">monomath culture</a> (<a href="https://hbr.org/2012/05/in-defense-of-polymaths">more reading if you're interested</a>). I wanted to show myself and anyone else who would click, read, and listen that I am a "Jack of all trades" and despite being a "master of none" (e.g. music production, audio engineering, web design, programming, creative writing, etc.) they are still worth doing. The ultimate statement being, "Just because a person isn't highly specialized in one task doesn't mean they are inconsequential." To whom I wanted to make that statement? I'm not sure, probably myself (those damn neurosis) but I more so just wanted to put it out in the ether; <a href="http://mannymarx.com/Diaspora#sec10">the Strata</a>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In most respects Diaspora was produced similarly to my first album <a href="https://mannymarx.bandcamp.com/album/vagabond">Vagabond</a>. Like Vagabond, I used many samples from relatively forgotten music from the 60s and 70s. However instead of the in-your-face approach I took in the previous album I experimented with a wide array effects. I wasn't keen on using my own voice on every song but I had to make due. That being said, I am forever grateful to my friends <a href="http://www.bullafey.com">Bulla Fey</a> for working with me on Arp 87. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This album is intended to be listened to exactly how it was written, with headphones, late at night, in a dark room only illuminated by a screen. My intention is for you to come into this reality I've created
