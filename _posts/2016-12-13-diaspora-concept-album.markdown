                     The heater is beeping again, either it's out of kerosene or another 3 hours have passed by. Focused on the 5k display, obsessed,  realizing the vision I which had been stuck in my head since I left for work that morning straight through the day until I got home. Morning...Work! I glide the cursor up to the top of the screen, completely oblivious to what time it could possibly be. 11pm or 2am, I'm not sure and it doesn't matter because I know I'm not going to bed until I finish what I set out to do. Awesome it's only half past 1. I hope my wife doesn't too upset if I don't sleep tonight, again.

                    <a href="http://mannymarx.com/Diaspora">"Diaspora</a> was more than just an album to me. I guess I could call it a <i>"passion project"</i> but that sounds too ridged and divisive, Diaspora was more USE WORD THAT MEANS DEEP than that. Diaspora pushed me to my limits creatively and whatever the opposite of creatively is. Not only was I composing music and writing lyrics but I was also designing and coding a dynamic web-page from scratch. There is probably some Ancient Greek or German word which sums it up better but in layman's terms I was firing at all cylinders. There were many days where I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRG7fZuQSk0">"ignited the midnight petroleum"</a>.

                <p>
                    <h3>So what exactly is Diaspora?</h3></p>

                     <p>Diaspora is a science fiction concept album / short story about(?) humanity's relation with itself, its relationship with technology, and its relationship with itself with technology. In brief, the setting takes place in the not too distant future right after a super virus brings the world's population, in less than a decade, to a few billion people. This shock to the system birthed a paradigm shift in how humans related to each other and objective reality. Also, in the mad-dash for a cure to combat the virus many technological breakthroughs took place. Notably, the ability to  digitize the mind, in large part inspired by Richard K. Morgan's cyberpunk masterpiece <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altered_Carbon">"Altered Carbon"</a>.</p> 
                     <p> The actual Diaspora album begins when an exploration team on Jupiter's moon Europa comes across an artifact which takes the form of a tesseract. The album itself are audio files of streams of consciousness from the distant future. These characters range from space janitors to patrons at a bar who is smitten by the barkeep.</p><br>

                    <p>Personally, Diaspora has a binary meaning. On one hand, it's an anthropological statement(?). On the other hand, it was a polymorphic endeavor or in other words, a challenge to my inner Renaissance man. Not to regurgitate too much of my neurosis on you but creating Diaspora was a push back against this current era's <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/we-live-in-a-one-track-world-but-anyone-can-become-a-polymath">monomath culture</a> (<a href="https://hbr.org/2012/05/in-defense-of-polymaths">more reading if you're interested</a>). I wanted to show myself and anyone else who would click, read, and listen that I am a "Jack of all trades" and even though I'm a "master of none" (e.g. music production, audio engineering, web design, programming, creative writing, etc.) it's still worth doing. The ultimate statement being, "Just because a person isn't highly specialized in one task doesn't mean they are insignificant." To whom I wanted to make that statement to I'm not sure, probably myself but I generally just wanted to put it out in the ether; <a href="http://mannymarx.com/Diaspora#sec10">the Strata</a>.
