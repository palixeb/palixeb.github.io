                <em>"<a href="https://carcosali.bandcamp.com/releases">Carcosa</a> is a fictional city in the Ambrose Bierce short story An Inhabitant of Carcosa (1891). In Bierce's story, the ancient and mysterious city is barely described, and is viewed only in hindsight (after its destruction) by a character who once lived there ... Later writers, including H. P. Lovecraft and his many admirers, became great fans of Chambers' work and incorporated the name of Carcosa into their own stories, set in the Cthulhu Mythos."</em>
                &mdash;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcosa">Wikipedia</a>.</p>

                <p>I have to admit it's been a few months since I have sat down and listened to some hard core. <img class="img-responsive" height="200px" width="200px" align="right" alt="Carcosa" src="https://f1.bcbits.com/img/a0990583475_16.jpg"> <!--more-->Actually I'm not sure what people would label this these days. I guess you could call it metal, too. I'm 35&mdash; I haven't been privy on musical genres since the PlayStation 2 release, my bad. The tags on <a href="https://carcosali.bandcamp.com/releases">Carcosa's bandcamp page</a> read: <em>"grind hardcore metal punk sludge New York"</em>. Whatever you choose to label them, Carcosa's "demo" is <b>elite</b>.</p> 
                

                <p>The four count on the hi-hat, the guitar and bass slide-in, and then the vocals blast through, "Feeling numb!", you just know you are in for a ride from the get go. On top of all that, whoever recorded Carcosa did a superb job. The three song demo takes no breaks as one song blends into the other. Kyle Molle, Dan Lomeli, Andrew Pandolfo, and Tim Lipman are on point and leave nothing left to be desired. My favorite part of the demo is during "No God" when it gets thrashy and Tim Lipman hit's an octave higher on his scream, "Cruuaaaaaash!!!11!!". It's dope, trust me.</p>

                <p>As on point as the music is, what stands out the most&mdash;like all quality hard core&mdash;are the lyrics. Carcosa doesn't pull any punches when it comes to what they want to say:</p>
                <p>
                <em>"I'm not You <br> I See Through <br>The Mystique of a Higher Power<br> I will Burn it Down<br> Your Temples to the Ground"<br></em></p>
                

                <p>Given the hard core aesthetic isn't appreciated by everyone, I can't help but wonder why. What better way to musically express raw emotion? Unlike most popular music that aims to sound "nice", sounding "nice" can be a distraction to a song's message. Take <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdz5kCaCRFM">Blue's Traveler's "Hook"</a>, it's a song about how lyrics don't matter, as long as it sounds "nice" people will like it. That song is like 20 years old and it's <strong>still</strong> trolling people. However, I guess some people are dispassionate about a song's lyrics and message. To each their own and all that.</p>

                <p>For those of you who do like music with a message, take the 8 minutes and give the Carcosa demo a listen while reading the lyrics. See what you take from the full package. Personally, I feel like it's about someone getting fed up and becoming nihilistic as they watch religious fundamentalism, war, and big corporations tear the planet to shreds. That's just my interpretation and it's pretty heavy for only 8 minutes of a music. A good conversation starter to say the least. What do you take away from it? Feel free to share your opinion on my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mannymarxmusic/?ref=br_rs">Facebook page</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/hirotsu">Tweet me</a>.</p></p>

                <p>I am really anticipating what Carcosa puts out next. I hope they pull some lyrical <a href="https://www.google.co.jp/search?q=cthulhu&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwigo8e3otTJAhUFLKYKHdBdAckQ_AUIBygB&biw=2025&bih=1502">imagery</a> from the source-material of their name and plug in more <a href="http://www.hbo.com/true-detective/episodes/1/01-the-long-bright-dark/index.html">True Detective</a> quotes!
