                <p> <b>Manny Marx (me):</b> I’m listening to the “wave ridin’ starter pack” as I am writing up these questions. That Final Fantasy remix of “Special” hits me right in the feels. So, for starters who is Bulla Fey, in other words, who are you guys? 

                <b>Bulla Fey</b>: We are Dominique Nichelle, vox, and Adam Maria, writing and production. A couple of friends in brooklyn making our way through life. Or trying.

                    <b>MM:</b>Does Bulla Fey have a particular meaning? If so, are you wiling to share it? (Also what is the correct way to pronounce it?)

                <b>BF:</b>Hmm, ok let's give it a try. "Bull - uh - feh" or bull-uh-fae. I know there is a proper way to do that stuff. It literally means Bubble Fairies. We're named after a neo-pets game.

                <p>How long have you guys been making music together? How did you meet? </p>

                <p>It's been about 2 years now. Although most of that was not making music. We were just trying to find ourselves. We met when I (Adam) had an ad floating around on craigslist for a vocalist. Dominique was looking to buy a chair for her apartment after she moved to NY from the UK. She saw my ad and hit me up, and we got together. We immediately became friends.</p> 

                <p>While we are on that topic, please, give a little background on what you were doing musically before Bulla Fey? </p>
                <p>Dominique was experimenting with musicians a bit in London, finding out that she had a voice. I was out here doing experimental projects with a band, my sister, making beats. Totally unsure if I even wanted to do music anymore. Which is something I always feel until something or someone inspires me. Meeting Dominque inspired me to see where else it could go.</p>


                <p>What / who are your influences and inspiration when making music for Bulla Fey? (keep in mind it doesn’t particularly have to be another music artist) </p>
                <p>Tim Burton, Florence and the Machine, Fiona Apple, Daughter, Rick Owens, taiko drums and bass, folklore. Faeries. Magic. Mysticism. The children of the forest.</p> 


                <p>What are you hoping to conjure up and elicit from the listener when you press the upload button on Soundcloud/YouTube? </p>

                <p>I don't think we are doing it to effect the listener. I don't think we're doing this to communicate. All I know is that we are searching for a feeling, something we experience in the creative process, something we don't find anywhere else, that releases a trapped thing inside us. In the process of unlocking something locked, in the way that is meaningful for us, a song is recorded. And I think what is in that song is an encapsulation of the experience we have in the process, the release, the therapy of it, the acknowledgement of it. It feels real to us, feels good, it's a kind of spiritual validation. I think it's sort of encapsulated in amber like a mosquito in Jurassic Park, filled with dinosaur blood, if we recorded a song. If we were being sincere and real, feeling that, someone will feel that too, when they hear that song. That would be amazing to us. Someone once told us that our music didnt have enough changes. And I thought, well, if we were making music for you, we'd have more changes. But we aren't. It would be similar to someone saying they are bored of me eating pepperoni pizza. So I should surprise everyone with broccoli. But, I like pepperoni pizza. When I want broccoli I will get it. We don't care if you don't feel what we feel, really. </p>

                <p>Hands down “Imagine Me” is my joint. “So good to be weightless, I don’t even need a space ship.” That line…it takes me somewhere. Do you have a method on how you guys write lyrics and produce the music? </p>
                <p>Imagine be is the least successful of our songs. But I enjoy it very much, so thank you. I usually just start making sounds, with the sub37 or drums, some synth thing. And if Dominique responds to it, if she's listening and is curious about a sound I keep working on it. If she likes what's happening she may hum along and I will react to that hum and write. </p>


                <p>What has your song writing process been like so far? </p>
                <p>Mostly the back and forth during a beat with Dominique. then When I'm alone I'll write something from the perspective of the entity or creature that speaks for the both of us. It has her voice and her face and our pain and my words. Then I can take her vocals and start to effect them, she lays down things both of what I asked for, and what I didn't. So there are surprises. </p>


                <p>You guys recently released a video for “LA BRUJA”. Is there any particular reason you chose that song? </p>
                <p>We have no budget, no anything. So it was the shortest song. And the latest song. Not much reasoning behind it aside from practicality. Because of our schedules, and lack of resources, simpler is always better. </p>


                <p>If you don’t mind, could you talk a bit about the song and symbolism with in the video? </p>
                <p>We just imagined something natural, and something urban that was easy to film. The birds behind the words, I knew we needed some trees so the park was fine. We had a nice drone shot thanks to our friend Cassidy Maldonado, in prospect park. The song is about the flow of someone on the verge of anxiety, someone who feels pressed to make a move and is convincing themselves of their power. Flanked by two powerful friends who created a sort of coven, or The Erinyes / Euminides from Greek myth. Imagines of ruin, I found a really old, sad discarded photo album in an abandoned gas station that made me really sad. I knew someone was squatting in there. What brought them to that place? I needed to us it. The video is definitely about our graceful, undercurrent of hidden anxiety, born of past loss and very frequent existential wander-offs. </p>


                <p>What’s next on the Bulla Fey menu? Another video? Another track? A live show? </p>
                <p>Hmm. another video yes. Another track, yes. And then after 2, a live show, yes. Within the next few months, I think. But we don't ever rush anything. When you push things, you hurt them. So we will let it go forward with its own power and it will let us know what's next. 

                <p>and shout outs to our friends, our supporters, our new fans, all the people who believe in us and enjoy what we do.</p>
                <br>
                
                <p>Peace</p>
