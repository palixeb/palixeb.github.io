                <p><a href="https://dirtwart.bandcamp.com/music"><span itemprop="name">DIRTWART</span></a> has been busy in 2015. With 7 individual releases, DIRTWART will take your eardrums on an electronic voyage.</p>
                <p> 6 of the 7 DIRTWART 2015 works are 2 song releases with  hypnotizing album artwork. <img class="img-responsive" src="https://f1.bcbits.com/img/a2593709105_10.jpg" alt="DIRTWART" height="200px" width="200px" align="right"> <!--more-->His recent releases use samples from 20 / 30 years ago (<em>i.e. the early 90's...yes you're old</em>) and a few from a bit <a href="https://dirtwart.bandcamp.com/track/choo-choo">earlier than that</a>. You will find  yourself often pondering, "What song is this from, again?"</p>
                <p>Even though some of his newer work is sample-heavy, the tracks take on a life of their own so it never becomes a hindrance.
                The effects and instrumentation have a retro 80's feel to them but without the cheesiness; it's all very mature yet still jocund. </p>
                <p>DIRTWART's self-titled first album is the only one of his releases which have vocals. The <a itemprop="url" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starscream">Starscream</a> / robotic vocal effects laid over cheerful melodies work surprisingly well. While I listen to the album, I can't help but feel a sense of melancholy or maybe better way to put it is a sober thoughtfulness. I can definitely see DIRTWART's music being used in a film.</p>

                <p>DIRTWART has a little something for everyone especially for those of us who are always are in search of something new. If you <em>had</em> to attach a genre to it, it would be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdpP0mXOlWM"><span itemprop="genre">Vaporwave</span></a> but with tracks like "<a href="https://dirtwart.bandcamp.com/track/beware">BEWARE</a>" the label doesn't do DIRTWART justice. I am looking forward to what DIRTWART puts out next and I really hope it has some more of those Starscream vocals on it!</p>

                <p>Peace</p>
