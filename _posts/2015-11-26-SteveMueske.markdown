                <p><a href="https://stevemueske.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Steve Mueske's</a> Dyads: <a href="https://stevemueske.bandcamp.com/album/dyad-1" target="_blank">#1</a>, <a href="https://stevemueske.bandcamp.com/album/dyad-2" target="_blank">#2</a>, and <a href="https://stevemueske.bandcamp.com/album/dyad-3" target="_blank">#3</a> are delicious musical morsels made with acuminous detail. Each Dyad is kind of like those <a href="http://tinyurl.com/qfqpcpo" target="_blank"> fancy dishes that come on a big plate with one small piece of food on it</a> but without any of the pretentiousness and much more filling.</p>

                <p>Seriously though, Steve Mueske takes full advantage of the audio-digital canvas. For example, in the track <a href="https://stevemueske.bandcamp.com/album/dyad-3">"Entropy's Song"</a> every buzz, each rhythmic pop, and all the <a href="http://www.teachmeaudio.com/mixing/techniques/panning/" target="_blank">panning</a> are delicately placed. The composition of each one of his songs display a massive library of well executed ideas. Another unique aspect about Steve Mueske's Dyads is that they are microtonal. In short, they consist of notes/tones which do not conform to typical Western music. I'll do my best to explain, <a href="http://mannymarx.com/img/Typical_Keyboard.jpg" target="_blank">here is a typical keyboard</a> most of us know. Now, if we break these notes / tones in to "steps" they <a href="http://mannymarx.com/img/Semitones.jpg" target="_blank">will look something like this</a>. As you can see each note on the keyboard differs from the two keys on either side of it by a half, typically refereed to as a "half step". <a href="http://mannymarx.com/img/Microtones.jpg" target="_blank">So with that in mind these are what microtones are</a>. If that doesn't make any sense, here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APtJsaPxNgo">youtube video of a microtonal keyboard</a>.
                For those of you that are well versed in micrtonal music,</p> <p><em>"Entropy's Song is in 26ed3, which is an octave and a half divided into 26"&mdash;Steve Mueske.</em> </p>

                <p>What I enjoy most about Steve Mueske's music are the beats. Typically with music as exploratory and ambient as his Dyads get, his never gets too airy and lost in themselves unlike ambient music tends to do. Going back to the fancy food analogy, as craftily designed as his dishes are the fact that they are still food is never forgone. I am sure most chefs can make a fancy dish with a big enough plate, as most musicians can make ambient music with a few <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_synthesizer" target="_blank">synth plug-ins</a>. The hard part is making it delicious and Steve Mueske accomplishes this with his solid beats and rhythms.</p>

                <p>Due to its level of maturity, I can envision Steve Mueske's music giving life to all kinds of media ranging from film to video games to television. His music has been part of my reading playlist while I have gone through <a itemprop="author" href="http://www.richardkmorgan.com/" target="_blank">Richard K. Morgan's</a> cyberpunk novel <a itemprop="name" href="http://www.richardkmorgan.com/books/altered-carbon/" target="_blank">"Altered Carbon"</a>. So if you are a fan of science fiction, Steve Mueske's music is right up your alley.</p>

                <p> Steve Mueske's creations are a pleasure to listen to and as a creator of music myself I can't help but to feel the need to step my creative game up. When you have the chance, head to Steve Mueske's <a href="https://stevemueske.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Bandcamp</a> or <a href="https://soundcloud.com/steve-mueske" target="_blank">Soundcloud</a> page and give his Dyads&mdash;as well as his other music&mdash;a listen. You can also see what he is up to on <a href="https://twitter.com/stevemueske" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. 

                <p>Peace</p>
