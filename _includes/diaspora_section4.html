                    During The Great Plague the entire planet was in a mad dash for a cure or vaccine which in turn lead to the unbanning of all unethical scientific research. By doing so a vaccine was not only created but breakthroughs in biology, neuroscience, computing, and many other fields. One of the more outlandish ideas is what actually lead humans to The Singularity. In short, it was to upload minds into a database, let The Great Plague run its course, and then re-upload the minds in to healthy clones of themselves. This theory later became a reality in 2242 and  the marriage of man and machine unlocked a new chapter in humankind's journey through the cosmos. </p>
