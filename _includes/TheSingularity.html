                    During The Great Phage, the entire planet was in a mad dash for a cure or vaccine, which in turn lead to groundbreaking research in all fields. And in less than a decade vaccine was not only synthesized but a synthesis of all fields of science ranging from sociology to neurobiology was realized. One of the major breakthroughs was what paved the way for The Singularity. In short, a plan to upload minds into a database, let The Great Phage run its course, and then download the minds into healthy cloned bodies. This plan later became a reality in 2242 and the marriage of man and machine unlocked a new chapter in humankind's journey. </p>
