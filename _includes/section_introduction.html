However, what I really like creating is music, especially with people. Whether it be a musical collaboration or crafting music and sounds from someone else's vision, I love it. In fact, I'd say I'm pretty good at it, too. But hey, don't take my word for it, check out what people who I have worked with have to say.</p>
