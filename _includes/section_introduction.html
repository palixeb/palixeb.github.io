                    <h3>I'm Manny Marx and I like make stuff. For example this website and even the desk I'm sitting at while I'm making this website. However what I really like to do is make music, especially making music with people. Whether it be collaborating musically or crafting music and sounds for person's vision, I love it. In fact, I'd say I'm pretty good at it, too. But hey, don't take my word for it, check out what people who have worked with me have to say. </h3>
