                    <p style="color: white">I'm Manny Marx and I like creating. For example, this website and also the desk I'm sitting at while I'm making this website. However, what I really like creating is music, especially with people. Whether it be a musical collaboration or crafting music and sounds from a person's vision, I love it. In fact, I'd say I'm pretty good at it, too. But hey, don't take my word for it, check out what people who I have worked with have to say. </p>
