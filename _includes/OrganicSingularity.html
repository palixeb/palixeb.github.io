                    The Organic Singularity began in 2211, the year the last deaths caused by The Great Phage were recorded. Humankind was brought to the precipice of extinction leaving most of the planet devoid of people. This pressured the vast majority of individuals to migrate to specially designated areas on each continent, eventually becoming megacities.  </p>

                    Society quickly realized that to maintain the quality of life in which law, order, and technology brings, they had to cooperate, at all costs. In just one generation concepts of nations, culture, race, class, religion and other dividing factors were nothing more than terminologies to understand the humanities' past. The unification of all people instantly birthed an almost religious fervor towards the exploration of the unknown.</p>

                   By this time virtually all menial and complex tasks alike could be automated and managed by a few presses of buttons and swipes on a screen. The concept of work changed from "a labor" to "a civil duty", meaning a person's task was done to maintain a level of comfort and stability. This concept resulted in the disassociation between work and monetary gain. With the virtual elimination of scarcity and capital, wealth no longer existed as it once did. Fame, prestige, and influence were rewards given to those who made great discoveries and broadened the understanding of the universe.  </p>
