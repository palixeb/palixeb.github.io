               <h2 class = "diaspora_report"><b>Vertigo</b></h2>

               <p class = "vertigo">The busy sky littered with satellites. 
                    Too expensive to properly decommission.
                    They meander across the night sky. 
                    Like lackadaisical shooting stars.
                    <br>

                    These city streets crowded with bodies.
                    Too numerous for any form of consideration.
                    They drone on from start to finish back to start again
                    3 dimensional clocks locked in an orbicular rotation.<br>

                    At the precipice.<br>

                    A misstep away from the event horizon. 
                    Living on the edge of three dimensional space.<br>

                    The loss of mortality breeds recklessness. 
                    This inheritance breeds arrogance. <br>

                    Decadence is a virtue when there’s nothing at stake. <br>

                      
                    On these gamble streets. 
                    Where can an ancient get some kicks?
                    After centuries of experience. 
                    Still itching for that fix.<br>

                    The writhing bodies. Temperature rising.
                    Tonight it all boils down to this.
                    Forget contemplating the secrets of the cosmos
                    We’re just prisoners to primordial licks.</p>
