From there we can set up our first meeting via Skype, G-chat, phone, face-to-face, or just stick to email, whichever you'd perfer. If possible, please provide a few reference materials (audio, visual, or both) to help with my research and creation process. Soon after I'll provide you with a demo (free of charge) and we can take it from there.</h3><h3>To read more about the creation process click the button below.</h3><br>
