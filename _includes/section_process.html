                		<h3> Well first contact me <a href= "#contact">at the bottom of the page</a> and I'll get back to you as soon as I possibly can. From there we can set up our first meeting via Skype, G-chat, phone, face-to-face, or just stick to email, whichever you'd perfer. If possible, please provide a few reference materials (audio, visual, or both) I can use help with my research and creation process. Soon after I'll provide you with a demo and we can take it from there. I don't charge for any of this so no worries.</h3><h3>To read more about the creation process click the button below.</h3><br>
