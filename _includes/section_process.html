From there we can set up our first meeting via Skype, G-chat, phone, face-to-face, or just stick to email, whichever you'd perfer. If possible, please provide a few reference materials (audio, visual, etc.) to help with my research and creation process. Soon after I'll provide you with a demo (sfree of charge) and we can take it from there.</p>
