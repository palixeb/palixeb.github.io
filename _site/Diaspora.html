                    The year is 2280, roughly 70 years after the Necro-Pelagicia Phage wreaked havoc on humanity, also known as the era of "The Great Phage". The Great Phage bottlenecked the human population to around 3 billion people. Amongst the sadness those who remained alive were left with an of abundance of resources and space. Further, since the deluge of death left not one person unaffected, humanity's empathy and appreciation of life reached a level unseen in recorded history. This heightened empathy and understanding was later referred to as the "Organic Singularity". </p><br>
     
               <p class = "effect2">
                    Within the 30 years after the "Organic Singularity", breakthroughs in science led to the mapping of the human brain. It was this discovery which gave way to the digitization of human consciousness. This accomplishment was officially heralded as "The Singularity”. Needless to say, such a breakthrough raised a great number of ethical issues. However, thanks to the paradigm shift caused by the Organic Singularity, humanity dealt and continues to deal with these complex issues responsibly. Some of the more complex issues are typically dealt with by a committee aided by the A.I., Nyame. <br></p>
          
               <p class = "effect3">
                    Despite the many recreational advances digitized consciousness provides, it has been primarily used for what has driven humanity ever since it climbed down from the trees and set foot on the African Savanna, exploration. Humans now explore the depths of the ocean, the deepest caverns, and of course the final frontier, space. On March 30th, 2280 during an expedition to Jupiter's moon Europa, an ancient yet advanced "alien artifact" was discovered. However, to humanity's surprise, it wasn't "ancient" or "alien" at all but actually from the distant future and a rather bleak one at that.</p>

                    During the later half of the 2100's deep sea oil mining became the main source of energy acquisition. Unfortunately, within this ancient biomass a super-virus laid dormant for 100's of millions of years. The Necro-Pelagicia Phage more commonly refered to as "The Great Phage", brought humankind to its knees. With a 90% fatality rate it wiped out over 50% of the human population, roughly 5 billion people, in the span of 7 years. To make matters worse many of the survivors were left infertile due to a side effect of the vaccination.</p>

               <p class = "effect1">
                    The Organic Singularity officially began in 2211, the year of last recorded deaths from The Great Phage. Humankind was brought to the precipice of extinction leaving most of the planet devoid of people. This pressured the vast majority of individuals to migrate to specially designated areas on each continent, eventually becoming mega cities. </p>
               <p class = "effect2">
                    Society quickly realized that in order to maintain the quality of life in which law, order, and technology brings, they had to cooperate with one another, at all costs. In just one generation concepts of nations, culture, race, class, religion and other dividing factors were nothing more than terminologies to describe the past. The unification of humanity instantly birthed an almost religious fervor towards the exploration of the cosmos.</p>
               <p class = "effect3">
                    By this time virtually all menial and complex tasks alike could be automated and managed by a few presses of buttons and swipes on a screen. The concept of work changed from "a labor" to "a duty", meaning work is done to maintain a level of comfort and mostly disassociated from monetary gain. With the virtual elimination of scarcity, capital and wealth no longer existed as they once did. Fame, power, and influence were rewards given to those who made great discoveries and broadened the understanding of the universe. </p>

                    During The Great Phage the entire planet was in a mad dash for a cure or vaccine, which in turn lead to the unbanning of all unethical scientific research. For the first time in ages research and experimentation were liberated. Therefore, just in the matter of a few years a vaccine was not only synthesized but a number of breakthroughs in biology, neuroscience, computing, and many other fields occurred. One such breakthrough is what actually paved the way for The Singularity. In short, it was a theory to upload minds into a database, let The Great Phage run its course, and then download the minds in to healthy cloned bodies. This theory then later became a reality in 2242 and the marriage of man and machine unlocked a new chapter in humankind's journey through the cosmos. </p>

               <p class = "effect2">
                    Found on Jupiter's moon Europa in its Conamara Chaos region. Studies show the Artifact is a tesseract-mechanism which is possibly "locked" in 3D space while moving along in lockstep with our present. What we do know for sure is that it streams information from hundreds–possibly billions–of years in the future. Currently, the information decoded by QCing (quantum computing) can only be observed in audio. Although some AI systems are reporting a likelihood of vetting visual information as well. These audio streams are mostly just passings thoughts. Still, as benign as these thoughts may be in their present time, even the most basic information from the future describing life throughout the Milky Way Galaxy is invaluable to us today.</p>
                    <p class ="effect3">Unfortunately, general consensus to indicates that despite the rather "utopian state" of humanity in 2280, we eventually will return to our "old ways" of exploitation, greed, and varying levels of strife.</p>

                    It appears that government-corporation hybrids(g-corps)are the most efficient method to colonize moons, planets, and asteroids for mining resources. Employment functions rather similarly to indentured servitude. The most recent analysis suggests these g-corps also monopolize the production of new bodies. These new bodies, also refereed to as sleeves, typically take a lifetime to payoff. Thus, many fall into debt with these g-corps. Although, one always has the right to opt out and upload to Strata, many choose not to and rather live indebted. </p>

               <p class = "effect1"> Now that the mind can be digitized the death of the body doesn't necessarily mean the end of the individual. At any time one can choose to have themselves uploaded onto the massive network of servers called "Strata". As of 2280 Strata is fairly a new concept still in its infancy. Many choose to spend much of their lives in and out of Strata. It's treated in a similar fashion to the way the Internet had been. Primarily, Strata is an insurance policy protecting a person form permanent death–as long as their uplink device (ULD) isn't too badly damaged. Despite of its dire importance it's also used as a form of entertainment. The main issue with Strata and digitized consciousness in general is having more than one copy of an individual. To prevent this from happening all Strata uploads are managed by a series of AI protocols. Also, if anyone within the Strata network cannot be directly traced back to a connected uplink ID they will be quarantined and possibly erased.
              </p>
               <p class = "effect2"> Based on the information gathered from the Artifact it seems that in the future Strata is seen as an afterlife. Namely a place for those to go when they can no longer afford a new body. Analysis also suggets that aside from the unified Strata of the 2200's, there are number of "Privatized Strata Networks" (PSNs). </p>

                    Currently inputing a mind into a machine for an extended amount of time is a highly controversial topic.
                    Experiencing a physical form that has no need for the basic functions biological lifeforms require has an array of effects on a person. Based on this stream that's probably not too controversial in the future. Further, it's apparent that long term exposure can led to some odd psychological patterns.

          <p class = "diaspora_report">It seems that in this era the mainstream culture—at least in this particular star system—is for humans to highly augment their physical form. Based on this stream the current star system wasn't as profitable as projected for a myriad of reasons. Nevertheless, settlers who either decided to settledown or were stranded due to a bad investment, now have to etch out a living. It appears this "Gaea" is the child of such circumstance or it might just be she prefers her natural form:</p>
          <p class ="gaea"><i>Brown eyes.<br>
          </i><br>
          <i>An un-augmented beauty, such a rarity since the singularity.</i><br>
          <i>Most younger than a couple of centuries are ignorant to what “natural characteristics“ even are.
          Blues, pinks, reds, varying levels of opacity, hell even ultraviolet 3 and Infrared 7, colors outside of the naturally<br>
          viewed color spectrum. Crowds’ colors akin to an oil spill, gone are blushes and tones of humanity.</i><br>
          But not her. Once called a “brunette” with skin the tone of the Earth’s soil…</i>
        <i>born perfect by the lucky roll of the genetic dice…</i><br>
         <i>Yet on a distant moon orbiting a hot jupiter in some shitty-unprofitable star system towards the center of the milky way.</i><br>
         <i>I sip my generic alcohol rehydrate and watch her work behind the bar.</i><br>
          <i>As she toils away for one tenth of a credit after another.</i><br>
          <i>The reddish light catches droplets of sweat running down her neck to her chest.<br>
          <i>Working hard serving patrons who resemble machines more than they do men.</i><br>
          <i>Her mundane characteristics leave her all but unnoticed except for an old-timer like me.<br>
         </i>She says her parents named her, Gaea.</i><br>
          <i>The irony.</i><br>
          
         <i>Truly, she is a goddess…</i><br>
          
          <i>A goddess… but a goddess lost in the stars.</i></p><br>

          <p class = "test"><b>Immortality-</b> Humans can "live forever" either in Strata, a virtual reality, or by re-sleeving (heavily based off of the Richard Morgan books):</p><br>
          <p><i>"In the novel's somewhat dystopian world, human personalities can be stored digitally and downloaded into new bodies, called sleeves. Most people have cortical stacks in their spinal columns that store their memories. If their body dies, their stack can be stored indefinitely. Catholics have arranged that they will not be resleeved as they believe that the soul goes to Heaven when they die, and so would not pass on to the new sleeve. This makes Catholics targets for murder, since killers know their victim will not be resleeved to testify. A UN resolution to alter this legal position forms one strand of the novel's plot, to allow the authorities to sleeve a deceased Catholic woman temporarily to testify in a murder trial.
          While most people can afford to get resleeved at the end of their lives, they are unable to update their bodies and most go through the full ageing process each time which discourages most from resleeving more than once or twice. So while normal people can live indefinitely in theory, most choose not to. Only the wealthy are able to acquire replacement bodies on a continual basis. The long-lived are called Meths, a reference to the Biblical figure Methuselah. The very rich are also able to keep copies of their minds in remote storage, which they update regularly. This ensures that even if their stack is destroyed, they can be resleeved.</i></p><p><a href="https://enwikipedia.org/wiki/Altered_Carbon"></a>&mdash;Altered Carbon Wikipedia page</p>

          <p class = "test"><b>Struggle- </b>Life is rough in the future. They still have to pay the bills and deal with the basic shit we go through today but with the possibility of a virtual reality afterlife at the end. Just like someone who lived in the Middle Ages might think living in 2015 is heaven on earth with iPhones, cheap food, and human rights, however, to us it's just another day and still far from perfect.</p>
          <p class = "test"><b>Apes in Space- </b>Humans didn't evolve to live in space nor “live forever”. What kind of conundrums would arise from such a situation? What kind of existential crisis would happen when you look in the mirror and see a totally new face from the one you were born with? What about orbiting a star that is 100x bigger than the sun? How would you feel if you have never even been to a planet called “earth” where humans evolved?</p>
