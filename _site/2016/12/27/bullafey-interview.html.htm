                 <p>As 2016 comes to a close it's a time for many to reflect on the past year. If I could sum the year up with one word it would be "Loss". Loss as in ruin, an instance of losing, a failure to gain, and a decrease in amount, magnitude, or degree. Whether it be the (add link) loss of loved ones, (add link) cultural icons, or the (add link) loss of a political struggles, personally and to many of those who are around me, 2016 was the epitome of the word. Yet, despite the unease and discomfort, we need loss, as it’s the catalyst for growth, change, birth, and renewal. With the nutrients from its decay and the void its absence creates, new things (think of better a better word) can flourish in its vacancy. From the undergrowth, admits the decay sprouts something new and unlike a phoenix’s rebirth, this is something novel. Something like Bulla Fey.</p>

                    <br>
                <p>While I write this I’m listening to Bulla Fey’s “wave ridin’ starter pack” on their SoundCloud page. The remix of “Special” hits me right in the feels because of a certain melody tucked away behind the chorus. Before I continue I implore you do the same.
                </p>

                 <p> <b>Manny Marx:</b> So, for starters who is Bulla Fey, in other words, who are you guys? </p>

                <p><b>Bulla Fey</b>: We are Dominique Nichelle, vox, and Adam Maria, writing and production. A couple of friends in brooklyn making our way through life. Or trying.                
                </p>

                <p>
                <b>MM:</b>Does Bulla Fey have a particular meaning? If so, are you wiling to share it? (Also what is the correct way to pronounce it?)</p>

                <p><b>BF:</b>Hmm, ok let's give it a try. "Bull - uh - feh" or bull-uh-fae . I know there is a proper way to do that stuff (bʊl – ʌ – feɪ). It literally means Bubble Fairies. We're named after a neo-pets game (add link).</p>

                <p><b>MM:</b>How long have you guys been making music together? How did you meet? </p>

                <p><b>BF:</b>It's been about 2 years now. Although most of that was not making music. We were just trying to find ourselves. We met when I (Adam) had an ad floating around on craigslist for a vocalist. Dominique was looking to buy a chair for her apartment after she moved to NY from the UK. She saw my ad and hit me up, and we got together. We immediately became friends.</p> 

                <p><b>MM:</b>While we are on that topic, please, give a little background on what you were doing musically before Bulla Fey? </p>

                <p><b>BF:</b>Dominique was experimenting with musicians a bit in London, finding out that she had a voice. I was out here doing experimental projects with a band, my sister, making beats. Totally unsure if I even wanted to do music anymore. Which is something I always feel until something or someone inspires me. Meeting Dominque inspired me to see where else it could go.</p>


                <p><b>MM:</b>What / who are your influences and inspiration when making music for Bulla Fey? (keep in mind it doesn’t particularly have to be another music artist) </p>

                <p><b>BF:</b>Tim Burton, Florence and the Machine, Fiona Apple, Daughter, Rick Owens, taiko drums and bass, folklore. Faeries. Magic. Mysticism. The children of the forest.</p> 

                <p>“Alive”, Bulla Fey’s first release, has garnished over 3,000 plays on Soundcloud in 10 months. For context, most unsigned artists barely break 200 plays in double the time. For me the intro and main theme are reminiscent of the 80’s cult classic film Legend. Dominique’s hypnotic vocals lead you through a haunting forest and trippy syths masterfully crafted by Adam. </p>

                <p><b>MM:</b>What are you hoping to conjure up and elicit from the listener when you press the upload button on Soundcloud/YouTube? </p>

                <p><b>BF:</b>I don't think we are doing it to effect the listener. I don't think we're doing this to communicate. All I know is that we are searching for a feeling, something we experience in the creative process, something we don't find anywhere else, that releases a trapped thing inside us. In the process of unlocking something locked, in the way that is meaningful for us, a song is recorded. And I think what is in that song is an encapsulation of the experience we have in the process, the release, the therapy of it, the acknowledgement of it. It feels real to us, feels good, it's a kind of spiritual validation. I think it's sort of encapsulated in amber like a mosquito in Jurassic Park, filled with dinosaur blood, if we recorded a song. If we were being sincere and real, feeling that, someone will feel that too, when they hear that song. That would be amazing to us. Someone once told us that our music didnt have enough changes. And I thought, well, if we were making music for you, we'd have more changes. But we aren't. It would be similar to someone saying they are bored of me eating pepperoni pizza. So I should surprise everyone with broccoli. But, I like pepperoni pizza. When I want broccoli I will get it. We don't care if you don't feel what we feel, really. </p>

                <p><b>MM:</b>Hands down “Imagine Me” is my joint. “So good to be weightless, I don’t even need a space ship.” That line…it takes me somewhere. Do you have a method on how you guys write lyrics and produce the music? </p>

                <p><b>BF:</b>Imagine be is the least successful of our songs. But I enjoy it very much, so thank you. I usually just start making sounds, with the sub37 or drums, some synth thing. And if Dominique responds to it, if she's listening and is curious about a sound I keep working on it. If she likes what's happening she may hum along and I will react to that hum and write. </p>

                <p>I think it’s insane that imagine me is their least successful of their songs. The composition, production, lyrics, and vocal delivery showcases–at least to me–how well the duo works together. Dominique became one of my favorite vocalists by how creatively she approached this track. 
                </p>    

                <p><b>MM:</b>What has your song writing process been like so far? </p>

                <p><b>BF:</b>Mostly the back and forth during a beat with Dominique. then When I'm alone I'll write something from the perspective of the entity or creature that speaks for the both of us. It has her voice and her face and our pain and my words. Then I can take her vocals and start to effect them, she lays down things both of what I asked for, and what I didn't. So there are surprises. </p>


                <p><b>MM:</b>You guys recently released a video for “LA BRUJA”. Is there any particular reason you chose that song? </p>

                <p><b>BF:</b>We have no budget, no anything. So it was the shortest song. And the latest song. Not much reasoning behind it aside from practicality. Because of our schedules, and lack of resources, simpler is always better. </p>

                <p>“Simpler is better” is the mantra of our generation and it might just be why so many are enamored with Bulla Fey. The team has 10 thousand plays on their “wave ridin’ starter pack” and 12 thousand on their “LA BRUJA” video on YouTube. I’d like to stress that there is no money machine or publicist behind the group. Each one of their plays and comments are not manufacture but authentic. </p>

                <p><b>MM:</b>If you don’t mind, could you talk a bit about the song and symbolism with in the video? </p>

                <p><b>BF:</b>We just imagined something natural, and something urban that was easy to film. The birds behind the words, I knew we needed some trees so the park was fine. We had a nice drone shot thanks to our friend Cassidy Maldonado, in prospect park. The song is about the flow of someone on the verge of anxiety, someone who feels pressed to make a move and is convincing themselves of their power. Flanked by two powerful friends who created a sort of coven, or The Erinyes / Euminides from Greek myth. Imagines of ruin, I found a really old, sad discarded photo album in an abandoned gas station that made me really sad. I knew someone was squatting in there. What brought them to that place? I needed to us it. The video is definitely about our graceful, undercurrent of hidden anxiety, born of past loss and very frequent existential wander-offs. </p>


                <p><b>MM:</b>What’s next on the Bulla Fey menu? Another video? Another track? A live show? </p>

                <p><b>BF:</b>Hmm. another video yes. Another track, yes. And then after 2, a live show, yes. Within the next few months, I think. But we don't ever rush anything. When you push things, you hurt them. So we will let it go forward with its own power and it will let us know what's next. 

                <p><b>BF:</b>Shout outs to our friends, our supporters, our new fans, all the people who believe in us and enjoy what we do.</p>

                <br>
                
                <p>Peace</p>
