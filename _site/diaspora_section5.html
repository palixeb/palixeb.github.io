               <p class = "effect1"> Now that the mind can be digitized the death of the body doesn't necessarily mean the end of the individual. At any time one can choose to have themselves uploaded onto the massive network of servers called "Strata". As of 2280 Strata is fairly a new concept still in its infancy. Many choose to spend much over their lives in and out of Strata. It's treated in a similar fashion to the Internet. Primarily, Strata is an insurance policy protecting a person form permanent death–as long as their cordial stack isn't too badly damaged. Despite of its dire importance it's also used as a form of entertainment. The main issue with Strata and digitized consciousness is the copying of an individual. To prevent this from happening all Strata uploads are managed by a series of AI protocols. Also, if anyone within the Strata network cannot be directly traced back to a connected cordial stack they will be quarantined and possibly erased.

               <p class = "effect2"> Based on the information gathered from the Artifact it seems that in the future Strata is seen as an afterlife. Namely a place for those to go when they cannot afford a new body. Analysis seems to also suggest that aside from the unified Strata of the 2200's, there are number of "Privatized Strata Networks" (PSN). Some PSNs exist solely for the purpose of its inhabitants leasing themselves to earn enough credits to buy a body to get back into the real world. </p>
