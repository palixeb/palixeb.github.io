          <h2>Intro</h2>
          <p dir="rtl" class="p6"><br></p>
          <p class="p1">The year is 2280 roughly 70 years after the final mass casualties of Necro-Pelagicia also known as "The Great Plague" that “bottlenecked” the human race's population to around 3 billion people. Due to the disaster, not to mention the level of technology, the remaining humans were left with an of abundance of resources and space. Further, the deluge of death left not <i>one</i> person unaffected and because of this humanity's empathy toward one another and appreciation of life reached a level unseen in recorded history. This heightened empathy and understanding is referred to as the <i>"Organic Singularity"</i>. <br>
          <br>
          Within the 30 years after the "Organic Singularity" breakthroughs in science lead to the digitization of human consciences which was deemed “<i>The Singularity”</i>. Needless to say the digitization of human consciousness raised a number of ethical issues. However, a number of check and balances were put in place, coupled with the paradigm shift of human’s consciences due to the Organic Singularity, humanity dealt and continues to deal with the issue responsibly. That being said it's not like people can upload themselves onto computers and go all Lawnmower Man. The current tech is more along the lines of controlling robotics and residing in a virtual reality upon death of the physical body (if one chooses to). The technology to upload into another brain / body is still in R&amp;D at this time.<br>
          <br>
          Aside from the major recreational advances digitized consciousness has brought forth it has been primarily used for what has driven humanity ever since it climbed down from the trees and set foot on the African Savanna, <i>exploration</i>. Humans now explore the depths of the ocean, the deepest caves, and of course the final frontier, space! In the year 2280 during an expedition to Jupiter's moon Europa an ancient yet advanced "alien artifact" was discovered. However, to humanity's surprise, it wasn't "ancient" or "alien" at all but actually from humanity’s distant future and a rather bleak one at that.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

          <h2>Part 1 “The Present Day”</h2>
          <p><b>The Great Plague</b></p>
          <p>During the later half of the 2100's deep sea oil mining became the main source of fossil fuel.However locked within these deep sea fossil fuels was a virus which laid dormant for 100's of millions of years. The Great Plague also known as <em>Necro-Pelagicia</em> was a virus which attacked the host's brain and with a 90% fatality rate it wiped out over 50% of the human population, about 5 billion people, in the span of 7 years. Out of the remaining 50% of people over half of them were left infertile due to a side effect of the vaccination.</p>
         
         <p><b>Organic Singularity</b></p>
          <p>The Organic Singularity officially began in 2211, the year of last recorded deaths from The Great Plague. Humanity was brought to its knees leaving most of the planet devoid of homo-sapiens. This pressured the vast majority of people to migrate to various areas on each continent, eventually becoming Mega Cities. 
          </p>
          <p>Humans realized that they had to operate as a single species in order to maintain the quality of life in which law, order, and technology bring. Concepts of nations, culture, race, and other dividing factors were nothing more than descriptive terminologies to describe life before The Great Plague. Humankind is more or less unified with almost a religious fervor towards exploration.</p>
          <p>By the 2100's virtually all menial tasks could be automated and managed by a few presses and swipes on a screen. Prior to The Great Plague, knowledge to maintain and repair technology was readily available on a number of databases at all times. However, due to maintaining the status quo the knowledge and access to such information was kept guarded by "paywalls" such as "certifications" and "degrees". The advent The Great Plague created a huge demand for everyone to take part in maintaining the systems that kept humanity at a certain level of comfort. The concept of "work" changed from being something people needed to do for money (which was then used to “pay” for survival and enjoyment) to a duty people did to keep things from not breaking down. Work became akin to pissing in a public bathroom instead of the streets and following traffic laws; it was just a duty everyone had to do in order to survive.</P>
       

          <p><b>The Singularity</b></p>

          <p>During The Great Plague the world was in a mad dash for a cure or vaccine which in turn lead to the unbanning of all unethical scientific research. By doing so a vaccine was not only created but the research lead to breakthroughs in biology, neuroscience, and computing. One of the more outlandish ideas is what actually lead humans to The Singularity. In short, it was to upload minds into a database, let The Great Plague run its course, and then re-upload the minds in to healthy clones of themselves. With the marriage of biology and quantum computing it became a reality in 2242. With the marriage of man and machine humanity unlocked a new chapter in their journey through the cosmos. </p>
  
          <h2>Part 2 "The Future"</h2>
        
          <p><b>The Artifact from the Future(Diaspora Album)</b></p>
          <p>Found on Jupiter's moon Europa in its Conamara Chaos region, the artifact consists of audio files describing locations, individuals, society, and more throughout the Milky Way Galaxy. It seems that despite the current state of humanity in 2280 it eventually will return to its "old ways".</p>
     
          <h3><b>Tracks</b></h3>
          <p>These tracks are just some ideas and nothing is finalized but it's just to give you a feel of the atmosphere of the album. Lyrically I am trying to capture the vibe from the Neuromancer and Altered Carbon novels, a mix of SciFi and a cyberpunk dystopian world where Corporations / Criminal organizations run the show. People have fallen back into the habit of willingly letting themselves be exploited and greed is once again the status quo keeping everything afloat.</p>

          <p><i>Approaching dock snr24. Another day, another credit.</i></p>

          <p><i>Most younger than a couple of centuries are ignorant to what “natural characteristics“ even are.</p>

          <p><i>Truly, she is a goddess…</i></p>

          <h2>Themes</h2>
          <br>
          <p><b>Multi-planetory / Star System Corporations- </b>They basically are a govt / corporation hybrids. Similar to Wayland-Yutani Corp in the Alien Films. It appears that the best way for humanity to  <br>
          
          <p><b>Immortality-</b> Humans can "live forever" either in a virtual reality or by re-sleeving (heavily based off of the Richard Morgan books):</p><br>
          <p><i>"In the novel's somewhat dystopian world, human personalities can be stored digitally and downloaded into new bodies, called sleeves. Most people have cortical stacks in their spinal columns that store their memories. If their body dies, their stack can be stored indefinitely. Catholics have arranged that they will not be resleeved as they believe that the soul goes to Heaven when they die, and so would not pass on to the new sleeve. This makes Catholics targets for murder, since killers know their victim will not be resleeved to testify. A UN resolution to alter this legal position forms one strand of the novel's plot, to allow the authorities to sleeve a deceased Catholic woman temporarily to testify in a murder trial.
          While most people can afford to get resleeved at the end of their lives, they are unable to update their bodies and most go through the full ageing process each time which discourages most from resleeving more than once or twice. So while normal people can live indefinitely in theory, most choose not to. Only the wealthy are able to acquire replacement bodies on a continual basis. The long-lived are called Meths, a reference to the Biblical figure Methuselah. The very rich are also able to keep copies of their minds in remote storage, which they update regularly. This ensures that even if their stack is destroyed, they can be resleeved.<a href="https://enwikipedia.org/wiki/Altered_Carbon"></a>&mdash;Altered Carbon Wikipedia page</p>
          </p>
          <p class="p1"><span class="s2"><b>Struggle- </b></span>Life is rough in the future. They still have to pay the bills and deal with the basic shit we go through today but with the possibility of a virtual reality afterlife at the end. Just like someone who lived in the Middle Ages might think living in 2015 is heaven on earth with iPhones, cheap food, and human rights, however, to us it's just another day and still far from perfect.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><span class="s2"><b>Apes in Space-</b></span><b> </b>Humans didn't evolve to live in space nor “live forever”. What kind of conundrums would arise from such a situation? What kind of existential crisis would happen when you look in the mirror and see a totally new face from the one you were born with? What about orbiting a star that is 100x bigger than the sun? How would you feel if you have never even been to a planet called “earth” where humans evolved? <br>
