          <p class = "test1">The year is 2280, roughly 70 years after the 10 year span of casualties by the Necro-Pelagicia Virus also known as the era of "The Great Plague". The Great Plague bottlenecked the human population to around 3 billion people. Due to this disaster, not to mention the level of technology, the remaining humans were left with an of abundance of resources and space. Further, the deluge of death left <i>not one</i> person unaffected and because of this humanity's empathy for their fellow man and appreciation of life reached a level unseen in recorded history. This heightened empathy and understanding was later referred to as the <i>"Organic Singularity"</i>. </p><br>
          <p class = "test2">
          Within the 30 years after the "Organic Singularity" breakthroughs in science lead to the mapping of the brain and the digitization of human consciences which was deemed <i>"The Singularity”</i>. Needless to say such a breakthrough raised a number of ethical issues. However, regulation through a number of check and balance implemented by AI coupled with the paradigm shift caused by the Organic Singularity, humanity dealt and continues to deal with this issue responsibly. <br></p>
          <p class = "test3">
          Aside from the major recreational advances digitized consciousness has brought forth it has been primarily used for what has driven humanity ever since it climbed down from the trees and set foot on the African Savanna, <i>exploration</i>. Humans now explore the depths of the ocean, the deepest caves, and of course the final frontier, space! On March 30th, 2280 during an expedition to Jupiter's moon Europa an ancient yet advanced "alien artifact" was discovered. However, to humanity's surprise, it wasn't "ancient" or "alien" at all but actually from humanity’s distant future and a rather bleak one at that.</p>

          <!--
          <p><b>The Great Plague</b></p>
          <p class = "test">During the later half of the 2100's deep sea oil mining became the main source of fossil fuel. However locked within this deep sea biomass for 100's of millions of years a virus laid dormant. "The Great Plague" also known as <em>Necro-Pelagicia Virus</em> attacked the host's brain and with a 90% fatality rate in primates it wiped out over 50% of the human population, roughly 5 billion people, in the span of 7 years. Out of the remaining 50% of the survivors over half were left infertile due to a side effect of the vaccination.</p>
         
         <p><b>Organic Singularity</b></p>
          <p class = "test">The Organic Singularity officially began in 2211, the year of last recorded deaths from The Great Plague. Humankind was brought to its knees leaving most of the planet devoid of homo sapiens. This pressured the vast majority of individuals to migrate to specially designated areas on each continent, eventually becoming Mega Cities. 
          </p>
          <p class = "test">Society quickly realized that in order to maintain the quality of life in which law, order, and technology bring they had to cooperate with one another. Concepts of nations, culture, race, class, religion and other dividing factors were nothing more than descriptive terminologies to describe life before The Great Plague. The unification of humanity instantly birthed an almost religious fervor towards the exploration of the cosmos.</p>
          <p class = "test">By this time virtually all menial and complex alike tasks could be automated and managed by a few presses of buttons and swipes on a screen. The concept of "work" changed from being something people needed to do for money to a duty people did to maintain a level of comfort. With the elimination of scarcity, capital and wealth no longer existed as they once did. Fame, "power", and influence were rewards given to those who made discoveries and broadened the understanding of the universe. </P>
       

          <p><b>The Singularity</b></p>

          <p class = "test">During The Great Plague the entire planet was in a mad dash for a cure or vaccine which in turn lead to the unbanning of all unethical scientific research. By doing so a vaccine was not only created but breakthroughs in biology, neuroscience, computing, and many other fields. One of the more outlandish ideas is what actually lead humans to The Singularity. In short, it was to upload minds into a database, let The Great Plague run its course, and then re-upload the minds in to healthy clones of themselves. This theory later became a reality in 2242 and  the marriage of man and machine unlocked a new chapter in humankind's journey through the cosmos. </p>
  
        
          <p class = "test"><b>The Artifact</b></p>
         <p class = "diaspora_report">Found on Jupiter's moon Europa in its <a href="http://www.planetary.org/multimedia/space-images/jupiter/PIA03002.html?referrer=https://www.google.co.jp/">Conamara Chaos region</a>, the artifact is believed to be a tesseract of audio files (possibly hundreds or even a thousands years in the future) describing various aspects of human life throughout the Milky Way Galaxy. It seems that despite the state of humanity in 2280 it eventually will return to its "old ways" of exploitation, greed, and varying levels of strife.</p>
     

          <br>
          <p class = "test"><b>Multi-planetary and Star System Corporations- </b> It appears that govt / corporation hybrids are best [see: easiest] way for humanity to colonize moons, planets, and asteroids for resources. Employment functions rather similarly to indentured servitude. Computer analysis shows that planetary corporations monopolized the production of new bodies. These new bodies, also refereed to as sleeves, typically takes a life time to payoff. So, many fall into debt with these corporations and run the risk of having their sleeve repossessed. Although, when that happens the individual is uploaded to Strata. <br>
          
          <p class = "test"><b>Immortality-</b> Humans can "live forever" either in Strata, a virtual reality, or by re-sleeving (heavily based off of the Richard Morgan books):</p><br>
          <p><i>"In the novel's somewhat dystopian world, human personalities can be stored digitally and downloaded into new bodies, called sleeves. Most people have cortical stacks in their spinal columns that store their memories. If their body dies, their stack can be stored indefinitely. Catholics have arranged that they will not be resleeved as they believe that the soul goes to Heaven when they die, and so would not pass on to the new sleeve. This makes Catholics targets for murder, since killers know their victim will not be resleeved to testify. A UN resolution to alter this legal position forms one strand of the novel's plot, to allow the authorities to sleeve a deceased Catholic woman temporarily to testify in a murder trial.
          While most people can afford to get resleeved at the end of their lives, they are unable to update their bodies and most go through the full ageing process each time which discourages most from resleeving more than once or twice. So while normal people can live indefinitely in theory, most choose not to. Only the wealthy are able to acquire replacement bodies on a continual basis. The long-lived are called Meths, a reference to the Biblical figure Methuselah. The very rich are also able to keep copies of their minds in remote storage, which they update regularly. This ensures that even if their stack is destroyed, they can be resleeved.</i></p><p><a href="https://enwikipedia.org/wiki/Altered_Carbon"></a>&mdash;Altered Carbon Wikipedia page</p>
          </p>
          <p class = "test"><b>Struggle- </b>Life is rough in the future. They still have to pay the bills and deal with the basic shit we go through today but with the possibility of a virtual reality afterlife at the end. Just like someone who lived in the Middle Ages might think living in 2015 is heaven on earth with iPhones, cheap food, and human rights, however, to us it's just another day and still far from perfect.</p>
          <p class = "test"><b>Apes in Space- </b>Humans didn't evolve to live in space nor “live forever”. What kind of conundrums would arise from such a situation? What kind of existential crisis would happen when you look in the mirror and see a totally new face from the one you were born with? What about orbiting a star that is 100x bigger than the sun? How would you feel if you have never even been to a planet called “earth” where humans evolved?</p>

Based on the information of the audio file it seems that the current star system wasn't as profitable as projected for a myriad of reasons.
