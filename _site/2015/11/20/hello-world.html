                <p class="lead" style="text-alight:justified">So this is it. After weeks of watching YouTube videos, combing through tomes of stackoverflow posts, reading a ton of blogs / articles, and very late nights / early mornings. It's <b>DONE</b>.</p>
                <p>... well kind of...it's done for the most part.... <strong><a href="www.mannymarx.com">mannymarx.com</a></strong> has been something I have wanted to do for awhile; that is to build a website as well as connect creatively with people around the world. It feels so great to finally have this site up, running, and <em>responsive</em>—I hope. What feels even greater is being able to make music again.</p>
                <p><strong><a href="www.mannymarx.com">mannymarx.com</a></strong> is also a place for creators to have their creations displayed with the purpose of creating a network of creative people. I will share them here on this blog. If you have anything your like me to listen to, play, watch, or read contact me <strong><a href="/#contact">here</a></strong>, and I'll review it on here.</p>
                <p>Well, if you are in need of a looping tune for menu music, a beep, a plop, a bop, a full out song, or anything else, <strong><a href="/#contact">contact me</a></strong> and let's make these sounds a reality!</p>
                <p>Peace</p>
