# Manny Marx's Music Production & Sound Design Homepage

Homepage for to advertise music production and sound design services. 

The foundation / concept of the site was built off of the [Creative Template](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/creative/) from [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com) and then integrated into the Jekyll framework.The Contact form is from http://formspree.io/.


##Personal project 

This is my first attempt at building / designing a website, it is a challenge I have wanted to take on for sometime. I started the website from a Bootstrap template and then built on it through Google-ing, Youtube-ing, and a ton of trial and error, Finally after a week I was able to make something, in my opinion (^^;, *"presentable"*. There is undoubtedly a ton of bad practices and redundancy as well as code that has no purpose. This a work in progress that I hope to continue to refine while learning web-development / design, so any advice will be welcomed and greatly appreciated. 


##Jekyll serve

When running the Jekyll server instead of `jekyll serve` run `jekyll serve --watch --config _config.yml,_config-dev.yml` It's mainly to help with work flow because if you just run `jekyll serve` you will have to restart the server anytime you want to view a change on localhost:XXXX. However, if you make a change to the _config.yml file you will have to restart the server.
